# Nelly Furtado – セイ・イット・ライト

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
In the day In the night
Say it right Say it all
You either got it Or you don't
You either stand or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan
Oh you don't mean
nothing at all to me
No you don't mean
nothing at all to me
Do you got what
it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean
everything to me
I can't say say
that I'm not not lost lost
and at fault fault
I can't say can't say
that I don't don't
love the light light
and the dark dark
I can't say that I don't don't
know that I am alive
And all of what I feel feel
I could show show
You tonite you tonite
Oh you don't mean
nothing at all to me
No you don't mean
nothing at all to me
Do you got what
it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean
everything to me
From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth I could sing you
another brick that I laid
From my body From my body
I could show you
I could show you
a place a place God knows
You should know
the space is holy
Do you really want to go
